            There are few negative things and few positive things about this school.

            I have been here since a very long time. I have experienced some positivity from few teachers and some 
            toxicity from few teachers. The administration of the school is very nice as well as the maintainence.
            I have experienced that almost teachers do not take students' complain seriously and they do nothing to bad students. But this was some years
            ago. Now there are strict teachers who don't tolerate indiscipline. Thanks to the principal of our school for taking action on considerable mischief.

            About 3-4 years ago, a boy teared a page on which classwork was written out of my notebook without any reason and the teacher did not punish him.
            
            On the other end, there was a very nice teacher who resigned because of mischeivious students.

            I have experienced a lot of things like this and now since our old principal is back things are getting better. 
            There were no developments in the school when she was not the principal, but now we are seeing a lot of new concepts and events and activities.
            
            So, finally I would say that during the past few years, the school has developed structurally a lot, but the mentality of a lot of students needs to be developed
