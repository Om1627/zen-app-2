                <p>The word ZEN is a Japanese attempt to pronounce the Chinese word “Chan”,
                     which in turn is a Chinese attempt to pronounce the Sanskrit word “Dhyana”,
                      which translates to “Meditation”. When one intellectually dwells into present moment,
                       one completely dissolves into whatever activity one manifests. One becomes the activity.

                       Simplicity is often associated with ZEN, ZEN practice is indeed simple,
                        if not easy. Just practice being fully present, right here, right now.
                         Perceive directly, without filtering percept ions through beliefs and preconceptions.
